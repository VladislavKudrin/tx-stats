# Metadata Labels Report

A small utility that compiles a JSON report about Cardano transaction metadata usage over the last ~6 epochs (≈30 days). The `run.py` script connects to a [db-sync](https://github.com/IntersectMBO/cardano-db-sync), looks at the latest fully completed epochs, and combines the on-chain data with several public registries to produce ranked statistics for governance metadata labels and well-known dApps.

## Data sources

- Cardano chain data available through the database (epoch boundaries, transactions, metadata, outputs); all SQL lives in `sql/`.
- [CIP-0010](https://github.com/cardano-foundation/CIPs/blob/master/CIP-0010/registry.json) registry (`cip10_registry.json` cache under `data/`).
- Contract/script registries from [CRFA](https://github.com/mezuny/crfa-offchain-data-registry/tree/main/dApps_v2) and [Strica](https://github.com/StricaHQ/cardano-contracts-registry/tree/master/projects) for mapping validator script hashes to project names; the script merges both, preferring Strica names.

## Configuration

Set the database credentials via environment variables or a `.env` file (loaded automatically):

```
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=cexplorer
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=secret
```

`run.py` also honors `data/last_pr_epoch.txt`, which stores the last epoch that produced a report so the script can skip duplicate runs.

## Usage

1. Ensure the database is caught up and the credentials above work.
2. (Optional) Remove `data/last_pr_epoch.txt` if you need to re-emit a report for the same epoch.
3. Run the generator:

```
python run.py
```

## Output

`data/report.json` contains:

```
{
  "metadata": {
    "generated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "chainEpoch": 512,
    "description": "Transaction stats for reporting period",
    "reportingWindow": {
      "start": "...",
      "end": "..."
    },
    "epochs": "~6 epochs (30 days)",
    "totalTxCount": 123456
  },
  "appStats": [
    {"label": "jpg.store", "displayName": "JPG Store", "txCount": 4200, "rank": 1},
    ...
  ],
  "metadataLabelStats": [
    {"label": 674, "txCount": 8000, "verified": true, "description": "...", "rank": 1},
    ...
  ]
}
```

The `appStats` section ranks projects by the number of transactions seen on their registered validator scripts, while `metadataLabelStats` highlights the most-used metadata labels and whether they appear in CIP-0010. (A more detailed label 674 message breakdown exists in `sql/674_messages.sql` and is easy to re-enable if needed.)

## SQL reference

- `sql/current_epoch.sql` – derives the rolling epoch window boundaries.
- `sql/validator_tx_counts.sql` – counts distinct transactions hitting known validator payment credentials.
- `sql/label_counts.sql` – counts distinct transactions per metadata label.
- `sql/total_tx_count.sql` – total distinct transactions in the reporting window.
- `sql/674_messages.sql` – helper query to inspect individual label 674 `msg` entries (currently unused).
